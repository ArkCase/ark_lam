.TH PHP 8.2 container image
.PP
This container image includes PHP 8.2 as a S2I
\[la]https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image\[ra] base image for your PHP 8.2 applications.
Users can choose between RHEL and CentOS Stream based builder images.
The RHEL UBI images are available in the Red Hat Container Catalog
\[la]https://access.redhat.com/containers/\[ra],
the CentOS Stream images are available on Quay.io
\[la]https://quay.io/organization/sclorg\[ra],
and the Fedora images are available in Quay.io
\[la]https://quay.io/organization/fedora\[ra]\&.
The resulting image can be run using podman
\[la]https://github.com/containers/libpod\[ra]\&.

.PP
Note: while the examples in this README are calling \fB\fCpodman\fR, you can replace any such calls by \fB\fCdocker\fR with the same arguments

.SH Description
.PP
PHP 8.2 available as container is a base platform for
building and running various PHP 8.2 applications and frameworks.
PHP is an HTML\-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers
to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built\-in database integration
for several commercial and non\-commercial database management systems, so writing
a database\-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding
is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

.PP
This container image includes an npm utility, so users can use it to install JavaScript
modules for their web applications. There is no guarantee for any specific npm or nodejs
version, that is included in the image; those versions can be changed anytime and
the nodejs itself is included just to make the npm work.

.SH Usage in OpenShift
.PP
In this example, we will assume that you are using the \fB\fCubi8/php\-82\fR image, available via \fB\fCphp:8.2\fR imagestream tag in Openshift.

.SH Source\-to\-Image framework and scripts
.PP
This image supports the Source\-to\-Image
\[la]https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/creating_images/s2i.html\[ra]
(S2I) strategy in OpenShift. The Source\-to\-Image is an OpenShift framework
which makes it easy to write images that take application source code as
an input, use a builder image like this PHP container image, and produce
a new image that runs the assembled application as an output.

.PP
To support the Source\-to\-Image framework, important scripts are included in the builder image:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\fC/usr/libexec/s2i/assemble\fR script inside the image is run to produce a new image with the application artifacts. The script takes sources of a given application and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. It utilizes some common patterns in PHP application development (see the \fBEnvironment variables\fP section below).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\fC/usr/libexec/s2i/run\fR script is set as the default command in the resulting container image (the new image with the application artifacts). It runs \fB\fChttpd\fR with PHP support enabled.

.RE

.SH Building an application using a Dockerfile
.PP
Compared to the Source\-to\-Image strategy, using a Dockerfile is a more
flexible way to build a PHP container image with an application.
Use a Dockerfile when Source\-to\-Image is not sufficiently flexible for you or
when you build the image outside of the OpenShift environment.

.PP
To use the PHP image in a Dockerfile, follow these steps:

.SS 1. Pull a base builder image to build on
.PP
.RS

.nf
podman pull ubi8/php\-82

.fi
.RE

.PP
An UBI image \fB\fCubi8/php\-82\fR is used in this example. This image is usable and freely redistributable under the terms of the UBI End User License Agreement (EULA). See more about UBI at UBI FAQ
\[la]https://developers.redhat.com/articles/ubi-faq\[ra]\&.

.SS 2. Pull an application code
.PP
An example application available at https://github.com/sclorg/cakephp\-ex.git is used here. Feel free to clone the repository for further experiments.

.PP
.RS

.nf
git clone https://github.com/sclorg/cakephp\-ex.git app\-src

.fi
.RE

.SS 3. Prepare an application inside a container
.PP
This step usually consists of at least these parts:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
putting the application source into the container
.IP \(bu 2
installing the dependencies
.IP \(bu 2
setting the default command in the resulting image

.RE

.PP
For all these three parts, users can either setup all manually and use commands \fB\fC\&./composer.phar\fR or other commands explicitly in the Dockerfile (3.1.
\[la]#31-to-use-your-own-setup-create-a-dockerfile-with-this-content\[ra]), or users can use the Source\-to\-Image scripts inside the image (3.2.
\[la]#32-to-use-the-source-to-image-scripts-and-build-an-image-using-a-dockerfile-create-a-dockerfile-with-this-content\[ra]; see more about these scripts in the section "Source\-to\-Image framework and scripts" above), that already know how to set\-up and run some common PHP applications.

.SS 3.1. To use your own setup, create a Dockerfile with this content:
.PP
.RS

.nf
FROM ubi8/php\-82

# Add application sources
ADD app\-src .

# Install the dependencies
RUN TEMPFILE=$(mktemp) \&\& \\
    curl \-o "$TEMPFILE" "https://getcomposer.org/installer" \&\& \\
    php <"$TEMPFILE" \&\& \\
    ./composer.phar install \-\-no\-interaction \-\-no\-ansi \-\-optimize\-autoloader

# Run script uses standard ways to configure the PHP application
# and execs httpd \-D FOREGROUND at the end
# See more in <version>/s2i/bin/run in this repository.
# Shortly what the run script does: The httpd daemon and php needs to be
# configured, so this script prepares the configuration based on the container
# parameters (e.g. available memory) and puts the configuration files into
# the approriate places.
# This can obviously be done differently, and in that case, the final CMD
# should be set to "CMD httpd \-D FOREGROUND" instead.
CMD /usr/libexec/s2i/run


.fi
.RE

.SS 3.2. To use the Source\-to\-Image scripts and build an image using a Dockerfile, create a Dockerfile with this content:
.PP
.RS

.nf
FROM ubi8/php\-82

# Add application sources to a directory that the assemble script expects them
# and set permissions so that the container runs without root access
USER 0
ADD app\-src /tmp/src
RUN chown \-R 1001:0 /tmp/src
USER 1001

# Install the dependencies
RUN /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble

# Set the default command for the resulting image
CMD /usr/libexec/s2i/run

optimal values. You can override this at any time by specifying the values
yourself:

.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fB\fCMaxRequestWorkers\fR was called \fB\fCMaxClients\fR before version httpd 2.3.13.
.IP \(bu 2
Default: 256 (this is automatically tuned by setting Cgroup limits for the container using this formula:

The MaxRequestsPerChild
\[la]http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild\[ra]
directive sets the limit on the number of connections that an individual child server process will handle.
After \fB\fCMaxRequestsPerChild\fR connections, the child process will die. If \fB\fCMaxRequestsPerChild\fR is 0, then the process will never expire.
.IP \(bu 2
Setting \fB\fCMaxRequestsPerChild\fR to a non\-zero value limits the amount of memory that a process can consume by (accidental) memory leakage.
.IP \(bu 2
